# What is Regular Expression?

you can learn about this  easily in [wikepedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression)

# How to convert Regular Expression to Automata?

I studied about it from [standford tutorial](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs/ch10.pdf)
I made a review slide, so I upload it to [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser773708/regular-expression-automata-230833527)
